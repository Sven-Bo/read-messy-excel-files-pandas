# Read Messy Excel Files

In the real world, Excel files are often not as neat and clean as the ones you might find in tutorials. Many times, they can be messy and poorly structured, making it difficult to extract the data you need. In this post/jupyter notebook, we'll explore how to read and convert these messy Excel files into a pandas DataFrame using Python. This will help you handle data more effectively, even when it comes from less-than-ideal sources.
